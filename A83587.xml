         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>ACcording to my promiſe, I ſhall continue to give you the certain intelligence from hence: in my laſt I acquainted you of the Enemies quitting Sir <hi>Harbottle Grimſtons </hi> houſe and of our firing the Court of Guard by the Almshouſes, which was on Tueſday laſt. On Wedneſday the enemy lay very ſtill in the town, the Suffolk Forces went on to intrench and put themſelvs as faſt as they could out of danger, ſome of the Lord Generals horſe and foot do aſſiſt them for that it is thought thoſe in the town will rather fal up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their quarters then of the old ſouldiers; and by this means wee hold a good correſpondency together, and keep the enemy in awe, they having made but one fally
<pb facs="tcp:161914:3"/>
forth that way as yet, and then were well beaten in again. Wedneſday night about 600. of our men in the dead of the night, caſt up another Work neere the town, the beſieged perceived it, yet made not any ſalley forth, nor gave the aſsaylants one ſhot till a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout ſix in the morning, at which time they ſent out ſome great ſhot, but our men were then in a good condition, and not much to be annoyed, and all the execution which was then made, was the killing of two horſes on our ſide, and one man; ſo wee have made good the Worke, and have alſo plained and made even the high-way, for the more facile bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up our train, which before for the roughneſſe and narrowneſse of the paſſage threatned difficulty, and diſadvantage to us. Our horſeguard at <hi>Chelm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> have brought in ſome perſons which are ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected to be going with intelligence from <hi>London</hi> to <hi>Goring,</hi> and confeſsed going back, that they had a purpoſe to go into the town, but could not find an opportunity, far it was beſieged cloſe on all ſides: Many eſcape out of the town to us, which proteſt they are in great ſtraights, and that they cannot hold out long, their hay is ſpent, and corne growes ſcarce, our Morter piece is comming up to us, and then we want not neceſſaries whereby to make them yeeld, if famine doth not compell them to it ſhortly,
<pb facs="tcp:161914:3"/>
The Lord Generall is exceeding deſirous to ſave the town, there being a great many well-affected godly perſons that have eſtates there, come out to him, and others in the town which cannot get out, And indeed it could not be imagined (conſidering the former report that this whole County was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us) that wee ſhould have found ſo much friendſhip amongſt them, as we muſt acknowledge we find from them, who voluntarily aſſiſt us with three Regiments of the County, and their hearts ready to bring proviſions to our quarters upon all occaſions.</p>
            <p>The town of <hi>Chelmsford</hi> ſent a <hi>Preſent</hi> to the <hi>Lord Generall,</hi> of two Kegs of <hi>Sturgeon,</hi> two freſh <hi>Salmond,</hi> a <hi>Veniſon,</hi> a dozen of <hi>Pullets,</hi> with great ſtore of <hi>Fowle,</hi> a Veſsel of Wine, with other Neceſsaries, ſo much a Vinegar to make ſawce.</p>

            <p>SInce my laſt of the 29 of June being Thurſday laſt, there hath happened theſe enſuing paſſages between us, and the forces in the Towne: On Thurſday in the afternoon was expected that they would make a ſally forth as they uſe to doe (like Birds in a Cage they ſtruggle the more) whereupon we laid an ambuſcado in the hedges, and faced the town with a party of horſe, at length there was a party ſallied forth, which was ſaid to be commanded by the Lo. <hi>Digby,</hi> upon this ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach our horſe retreated, as if they had feared by reaſon of their number, to give them a charge, here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Enemie purſued, and after our horſe had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated behind their Ambuſcapo, they faced about in a body, ſtanding as if they were reſolved to rec<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>eie a charge, which the ſalliers forth were reſolved to give, and to that end came on with great violence; but when they came where we had placed our ambuſhment, our men galled them very ſore, and our horſe came up and charged them repulſed the enemy, killed divers of them on the place, took a Leiu. Col. and divers others Priſoners, and purſued the Enemy to the Walls of the City</p>
            <p>We have almoſt finiſhed our new work neer the Almeſ-houſes, and have placed a Gariſon in Grimſton. and in another houſe neer the ſubburbs: In the town they are making of hand-mills, and boaſt that they are victualled for a moneth, yet confeſſe their allowances are very ſhort already, and are in want of Horſe meate, when our great peices and the Mortar-peice comes <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Have receiv'd daily intellegence of your proceedings at the Leaguer, and ſhall take an occaſion to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate unto you ſuch newes ar we have here, and that which is remarkable in the firſt place is, that the Parl. referred the buſines concerning the K. and a perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal treaty, to a Committee to conſider of, and report, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout which buſines the ſaid Committee met on Thurſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day laſt, and drew up certain particulars to be recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to the Houſes; one of the particulars thought fit by them to be repreſented to the approbation of the Houſe was, That forthwith there might be a perſonall trerty with his Majeſtie, 2 That the Bills formerly in debate to be preſented to his Majeſty for the royall aſſent before a treaty were began, might not be tendred to his Majeſty before the treaty begun</p>
            <p>Theſe and ſome other things were reported to the houſe by the ſaid Committee on Friday, and after ſome debate thereon, the further conſideration of ſome parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culers thereofy was referred to another day, viz his Majeſties co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming out of the Iſle of <hi>Wight,</hi> &amp; to which of his houſes he ſhould comewithin ten or twelve miles of London, of which you wil hear more ſhortly.</p>
            <p>By Letters out of Lincoln-ſhire it is advertized that that Col: Overton having notice that the Enemy from Pomfret caſtle had gotten into the Iſle of Axom he ſent 200 of his men in boats over the water at <hi>Eyres</hi> mouth and upon their approach the Enemy al fled and made what ſhift they could to get awar, ſo that that place is regained without the loſſe of any blood which we hereof.</p>
